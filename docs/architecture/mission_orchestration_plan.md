# Implementation Plan: Strategic Mission Orchestration & UI Standardization

## Objective
Unify the fragmented dashboards (Requirements, Exploitation, Phases) into a cohesive Mission Control pipeline and standardize the UI across all tabs to eliminate text overlap and visual clutter.

## 1. Mission Control Pipeline (`MissionOrchestrator`)
- [ ] **Unified Mission State**:
  - Implement a `Mission` entity that links a `Requirement` (the goal) to an `Exploitation Technique` (the method) and tracks it through the `Phases` (the execution).
  - Store in Firestore: `active_missions/`.
- [ ] **Autonomous Fulfillment**:
  - Once a Requirement is `APPROVED` in the Requirements tab, automatically assign an `AI Agent` to select an `Exploitation Technique` and begin execution at Phase 01.
  - Real-time updates to the `NeuralTerminal` on the main dashboard as missions progress.

## 2. UI/UX Standardization (Global Overlap Fix)
- [ ] **Universal Typography & Scaling**:
  - Implement a global CSS utility set for `text-truncate`, `line-clamp`, and `font-mono-xs` to ensure text fits within dense cards.
  - Standardize `ant-table` column widths across all management components (`APIManagement`, `RequirementsDashboard`, `AIAgentsDashboard`).
- [ ] **Component Grid Alignment**:
  - Update all sub-dashboards to use the `glass-card` container with consistent padding (`p-4` or `p-6`) and `min-h` constraints.
  - Resolve overlapping text in `PhasesOverview` by switching to a dynamic grid that adjusts column counts based on viewport width.

## 3. Real-time Feedback & Audit
- [ ] **Mission Logs**:
  - Add a "Mission Trace" view to the `NeuralTerminal` to show the step-by-step logic used by agents during a mission.
  - Link `AuditLog` entries directly to `MissionIDs` for forensic accountability.

## 4. Next Generation Feature: "Autonomous Improvement"
- [ ] **Self-Correction**:
  - If a mission fails at a specific phase, trigger the `SystemLearningDashboard` to analyze the failure and suggest a new `Exploitation Technique` (Autonomous Loop).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The transition from "Static Dashboards" to an "Active Mission Pipeline" is the final step in making SupremeAI a fully autonomous agentic system.
