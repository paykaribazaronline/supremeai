# Implementation Plan: Intelligent Chat & Contextual Memory System

## Objective
Develop a "Chat with System" interface that autonomously classifies user intent and manages long-term vs. ephemeral memory based on the nature of the conversation.

## 1. Intent Classification Engine (`ChatIntentAnalyzer`)
- [ ] **Multi-Label Classification**: Every message will be processed by a high-speed classifier (Gemini/GPT-4o-mini) to tag it as:
  - `COMMAND`: System-level actions.
  - `RULE`: Behavioral instructions (e.g., "Always use Bengali for error messages").
  - `PROJECT_PLAN`: Strategic goals.
  - `IMPLEMENTATION`: Direct coding/feature requests.
  - `CASUAL`: Friendly timepass/short-term info.
- [ ] **Autonomous Decision Logic**:
  - If `RULE`, trigger `UserPreferenceService` to save to permanent Firestore.
  - If `CASUAL`, route to `EphemeralStorage` with a 24-hour TTL (Time-To-Live).

## 2. Tiered Memory Architecture
- [ ] **Permanent Store (`LongTermMemory`)**:
  - Collection: `users/{userId}/active_rules`
  - Collection: `users/{userId}/project_blueprints`
  - Purpose: Rules stored here are injected into the System Prompt for all future interactions with that user.
- [ ] **Ephemeral Store (`ShortTermMemory`)**:
  - Collection: `chat_history_temp`
  - Feature: Automatic deletion of "low-value" data after a set period to keep the system lean.

## 3. Dynamic Context Injection
- [ ] **Rule Enforcement**:
  - Before responding, the system queries the `active_rules` for the specific user.
  - Rules are prepended to the LLM prompt to ensure behavioral consistency.
- [ ] **State Tracking**:
  - The chat interface will show a "Memory Status" indicator (e.g., "💾 Rule Saved" or "⏱️ Temporary Session").

## 4. UI/UX: The "Neural Chat" Tab
- [ ] **Interface Design**:
  - High-density, glassmorphic chat bubble system.
  - **Intent Badges**: Real-time badges appearing next to messages (e.g., `[Rule]`, `[Plan]`) to show how the system understood the input.
  - **Memory Toggle**: Allow users to manually toggle if they want a specific message to be "Remembered Forever."

## 5. Security & Privacy
- [ ] **Rule Validation**: Ensure users cannot set rules that bypass core system security or ethical constraints.
- [ ] **Data Minimization**: Automatically purge casual chat logs to protect user privacy.

> [!TIP]
> By distinguishing between "Rules" and "Conversation," the system becomes a personalized companion that grows smarter with every interaction without becoming bloated with irrelevant data.
