# 🧠 Implementation Plan: Dynamic AI Providers Hub

This plan outlines the architecture for a fully dynamic, zero-hardcoded AI Provider management system. The goal is to move away from static model lists and implement a real-time, self-validating discovery engine.

## 1. Zero-Hardcoding Architecture
### 🌐 Discovery Engine
- **Internet Search Integration**: Implement a "Real-time AI Discovery" search bar. When an admin searches, the system queries public AI registries (e.g., HuggingFace, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex docs) to fetch the latest model names and metadata.
- **Cloud/Server Sync**: Automatically scan connected Cloud Projects (GCP/Firebase) for deployed models or existing API keys.
- **Dynamic Registry**: All "available" models are stored in a Firestore `model_registry` collection, which is updated via the discovery engine.

## 2. Advanced Telemetry & Status Tracking
Each AI Provider entry will display a high-density telemetry block:
- **API Registry Count**: Number of unique keys currently configured for this model.
- **Health Pulse**:
  - `ACTIVE`: API is responding within latency thresholds.
  - `LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: API has hit rate or token limits.
  - `DEAD`: API key is invalid or revoked.
- **Usage Metrics**: Real-time throughput (Tokens/Min) and cost estimation.
- **Tracing Metadata**: Email of the user who provided the API key for accountability.

## 3. Dynamic Management Flow (Add/Delete)
### ➕ Adding a New API (Minimal Input, Maximum Automation)
1. **Model Discovery**: Admin types a name -> System searches the internet and suggests matches.
2. **User Input**: Admin provides the `API Key` and `Trace Email`.
3. **Auto-Detection**:
   - System identifies the Provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) based on key format.
   - System detects default model parameters (context window, max tokens).
4. **Validation (Live Test)**:
   - System performs a `ping-request` with the key.
   - If successful, it seeds the model into the production pool.
   - If failed, it returns a detailed error report.

### 🗑️ Deletion & Cleanup
- One-click revocation of API keys.
- Automatic cleanup of associated quotas and metrics.

## 4. Technical Strategy
### 🛠️ Frontend Components (Admin Dashboard)
- **DiscoverySearch**: A search component with auto-complete from live web results.
- **ProviderTelemetryTable**: A high-density table with real-time health indicators (using the custom CSS utilities for zero-overlap).
- **ValidationModal**: A "Testing..." animation that runs during API key verification.

### ⚙️ Backend Integration (Spring Boot / Firebase)
- **DiscoveryService**: Handles the internet search for model names and metadata.
- **KeyValidationService**: A secure service to perform test requests for various AI providers.
- **Firestore Triggers**: Automatically update "Limit Crossed" status based on real-time usage monitoring.

## 5. Success Criteria
- [ ] **Zero Static Lists**: No mention of "GPT-4" or "Claude-3" in the source code; all come from the registry.
- [ ] **Instant Feedback**: API validation completes in under 3 seconds.
- [ ] **Full Accountability**: Every key is linked to an email and has a clear health status.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The system must handle provider-specific error codes (e.g., 401 for Invalid Key, 429 for Quota) to accurately transition statuses between `ACTIVE`, `LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, and `DEAD`.
