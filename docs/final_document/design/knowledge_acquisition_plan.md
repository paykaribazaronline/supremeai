# Implementation Plan: Recursive Knowledge Acquisition System

## Objective
Transform the "System Learning" tab into a proactive, recursive knowledge crawler that allows the system to autonomously expand its intelligence base based on admin-defined domains and AI recommendations.

## 1. Backend: Autonomous Learning Subsystem
- [ ] **Knowledge Domain Registry (`KnowledgeService`)**:
  - Define `KnowledgeDomain` schema: `name`, `keywords`, `status` (IDLE, LEARNING, COMPLETE), `lastUpdated`, `depth`.
  - Store domains in Firestore: `system_learning/domains`.
- [ ] **Internet Search & Extract Pipeline**:
  - Implement a "Search-to-KB" flow: Web Search -> LLM Filtering -> Structured Extraction -> Firestore `knowledge_base`.
  - Add a trigger-based `StartLearningJob` that processes active domains.
- [ ] **System Recommendation Engine**:
  - Periodic task to analyze current knowledge gaps and suggest new domains.
  - Store suggestions in `system_learning/recommendations`.

## 2. Frontend: Learning Command Center (`SystemLearningDashboard.tsx`)
- [ ] **Knowledge Snapshot View**:
  - Replace/Update KPIs to show: `Total Knowledge Nodes`, `Top Learning Domains`, `Last Discovery Time`, `Discovery Efficiency`.
- [ ] **Domain Management Matrix**:
  - Add/Remove learning topics (e.g., "React 19 Best Practices", "Spring Boot Virtual Threads").
  - "Start Learning Now" button: High-visibility action to trigger the backend crawler.
- [ ] **Learning Queue (Proposals)**:
  - Responsive list of system-suggested topics.
  - Actions: `APPROVE` (promotes to Domain), `DECLINE` (dismisses proposal).

## 3. Real-time Status Monitoring
- [ ] **Crawl Pulse**:
  - Real-time progress bar/status during active learning cycles.
  - Visual terminal feed showing snippets of "Discovered Facts" during the process.

## 4. Integration & UI/UX
- [ ] **No Overlap Design**:
  - Ensure the Knowledge Snapshot and Domain Matrix are perfectly aligned in the 12-column grid.
  - Use glassmorphism cards with distinct emerald/amber states for learning status.

> [!NOTE]
> This plan shifts the focus from "pattern recognition" to "knowledge acquisition", making the system truly capable of autonomous self-improvement.
