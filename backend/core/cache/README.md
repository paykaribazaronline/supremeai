# Cache Management

This directory provides the core caching infrastructure for the SupremeAI project, designed to significantly optimize performance, reduce operational costs, and enhance the efficiency of AI model interactions. It achieves this through a sophisticated combination of multi-layered caching strategies, intelligent API proxying, and robust Redis management, ensuring fast response times and cost-effective utilization of external AI services.

## Core Components

*   **`autocache_proxy.py`**: Provides the `AutocacheProxy`, an intelligent API cost optimization engine designed to intercept and manage external API calls, particularly to large language models, through semantic caching and request deduplication.
*   **`multi_layer_cache.py`**: Implements a robust, multi-layered caching system that orchestrates a five-tier caching strategy to optimize response times and reduce AI model inference costs.
*   **`redis_manager.py`**: Manages asynchronous interactions with a Redis cache, providing a centralized and secure interface for general key-value caching and specialized operations.
*   **`semantic_cache.py`**: Implements a dynamic, vector-based semantic cache for AI model responses, leveraging an `ExperienceDatabase` to store and retrieve responses based on semantic similarity.
